This app is a personal wine sommelier.  Never pick the wrong wine for dinner again! This website lets users search any type of wine. It will display maker's notes as well as recipe pairings. Users can click on the "heard it through the grapevine" button to have maker's notes narrated to them by a rotating gif from an array.  They can also store their favorite wines for later usage.
